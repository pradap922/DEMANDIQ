# DEMANDIQ
Built an offline ML-based forecasting system (Flask + Prophet + XGBoost) that predicts weekly product demand and generates stock replenishment plans.
🧠 DEMANDIQ — Retail Sales Forecasting & Stock Planning

A full offline forecasting system that predicts weekly demand for each Store + Department, calculates required stock, and recommends order quantity based on safety percentage.

This project is built using:

Flask (Backend API + UI)

Prophet Forecasting Model

XGBoost Regression

Custom offline chart engine (No CDN / No Internet required)

🔥 Why DEMANDIQ?

Retail stores often guess inventory without data → overstock or stockout.

➡️ DEMANDIQ replaces guesswork with real time-series forecasting.

It provides:

✔ Past weekly sales trend
✔ Future demand prediction
✔ Safety stock calculation
✔ Required stock per week
✔ Suggested Purchase Quantity
✔ Visual charts + Table breakdown
